# Quarterly Reviews

## How to Use

1. **Every 90 days** (ideally March 31, June 30, Sept 30, Dec 31), block 60-90 minutes of uninterrupted time
2. **Create a new file** named `YYYY-Qn.md` (e.g., `2025-Q1.md`)
3. **Copy the template** from `TEMPLATE_quarterly_review.md`
4. **Work through each section thoughtfully** — this is your strategic pause
5. **Identify one major adjustment** for the next quarter
6. **Update your goals, North Star, or memory.md** as needed

## Why Quarterly Reviews Work

- **90 days is the perfect recalibration interval** — long enough to see real progress, short enough to course-correct before it's too late
- **Goals drift without checkpoints** — the quarterly review catches drift early
- **Energy and alignment shift** — what energized you in Q1 might drain you by Q3. The quarterly review surfaces this.
- **Patterns emerge** — if the same issue shows up in multiple quarters, it's not a fluke. It's a system problem.

## When to Do This

- **End of quarter:** Reflect on what just happened while it's fresh
- **Start of quarter:** Set the strategic focus for the next 90 days
- **Pick one.** Consistency matters more than timing.

## What to Do With Past Quarterly Reviews

- **Annually:** Read all four quarterly reviews during your Annual Review to see the full arc of the year
- **When stuck:** If you're feeling misaligned, read the past 2-3 quarterly reviews. The pattern will be obvious.

## How This Connects to Other Reviews

- **Daily check-ins** feed into weekly reviews
- **Weekly reviews** feed into quarterly reviews
- **Quarterly reviews** feed into annual reviews

Each level of reflection builds on the one below it. Don't skip the foundation.
