# Weekly Reviews

## How to Use

1. **Every Friday or Sunday**, create a new file named `YYYY-Www.md` (e.g., `2025-W03.md` for the third week of 2025)
2. **Copy the template** from `TEMPLATE_weekly_review.md`
3. **Spend 15 minutes reflecting** on what mattered, what didn't, and what to adjust
4. **Identify ONE adjustment** for the next week
5. **Actually implement it**

## Why Weekly Reviews Work

- **15 minutes prevents small misalignments from becoming major problems**
- **You catch drift early** — a week off-course is easy to correct; a quarter off-course is painful
- **It forces prioritization** — not everything matters equally, and the weekly review surfaces what actually moved the needle
- **Patterns become visible** — if the same friction point shows up for 3 weeks straight, it's not bad luck; it's a system issue

## When to Do This

- **Friday afternoon:** Reflect on the week before you close it out
- **Sunday evening:** Set the tone and focus for the week ahead
- **Pick one and stick with it.** Consistency > perfection.

## What to Do With Past Reviews

- **Monthly:** Skim the past 4 weekly reviews to spot patterns
- **Quarterly:** Use weekly reviews as input for your Quarterly Review
- **Annually:** Scan weekly reviews from the full year to see where you spent your energy
