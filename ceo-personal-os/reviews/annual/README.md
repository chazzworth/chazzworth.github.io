# Annual Reviews

## How to Use

1. **Once per year** (ideally late December or early January), block a full morning (3-4 hours) when you won't be interrupted
2. **Create a new file** named `YYYY_annual_review.md` (e.g., `2025_annual_review.md`)
3. **Copy the template** from `TEMPLATE_annual_review.md`
4. **Work through each section with full attention** — this is the most important reflection of the year
5. **After completing the review:**
   - Update `memory.md` with key insights and patterns
   - Revise `north_star.md` if values or mission have shifted
   - Update or write your Vivid Vision
   - Set 1-year goals for the next year
   - Update 3-year and 10-year visions if needed

## Why Annual Reviews Work

- **The annual review is the backbone of this system** — everything else (daily, weekly, quarterly) feeds into it
- **Patterns become undeniable** — what you've been avoiding all year becomes obvious when you sit with it for 3 hours
- **It prevents years from disappearing** — without reflection, years blend together. The annual review captures what mattered.
- **It surfaces misalignment early** — better to realize you're on the wrong path after one year than after ten

## When to Do This

**Best timing:**
- **Late December** (between Christmas and New Year's, when work slows down)
- **Early January** (first week of the new year, before the rush begins)

**Where to do this:**
- Somewhere quiet, comfortable, and free from interruption
- Not your usual workspace (a café, library, home, or retreat setting works best)

## What You Need

- This template
- Your quarterly reviews from the past year (if you did them)
- Your 1-year goals from last year (if you set them)
- Any past annual reviews, notes, or documents you've uploaded to `/uploads/`
- 3-4 hours of uninterrupted time
- Honesty

## What to Do With This Review

- **Reference it quarterly** — when doing quarterly reviews, check if you're on track with your annual intent
- **Read it next year** — when doing next year's annual review, read this one first to see what patterns repeated
- **Share selectively** — if you have a coach, mentor, or personal board of directors, this review can be a powerful artifact to share

## Common Mistakes

- **Rushing through it** — This is not a checklist. Sit with the hard questions.
- **Writing what sounds good instead of what's true** — No one is reading this. Be honest.
- **Skipping the lowlights** — The failures and disappointments teach more than the wins.
- **Setting goals before reflecting** — Reflection first, goals second. Always.

## Final Note

The Annual Review is where clarity comes from.

Do it right, and the next year becomes obvious.

Skip it, and you'll repeat the same patterns unconsciously.

This is the work.
