# Daily Check-Ins

## How to Use

1. **Every evening (or morning, if you prefer)**, create a new file named `YYYY-MM-DD.md` (e.g., `2025-01-15.md`)
2. **Copy the template** from `TEMPLATE_daily_checkin.md`
3. **Answer the five prompts honestly** — this should take 5 minutes max
4. **Save and close**

That's it. No need to read past entries daily. Just write, release, move on.

## Why Daily Check-Ins Work

- **5 minutes is sustainable.** You'll actually do it.
- **Reflection beats rumination.** Writing it down lets you let it go.
- **Patterns emerge.** After a month, read your entries. You'll see what's actually draining or energizing you.
- **It's private.** No one is reading this. No performance needed.

## When to Skip

If you miss a day, skip it. Don't backfill. The point is clarity moving forward, not perfect records.

## When to Read Past Entries

- **Weekly:** Skim the past 7 days during your Weekly Review
- **Quarterly:** Look for patterns across 90 days during your Quarterly Review
- **Annually:** Review the full year during your Annual Review
- **When stuck:** If you're feeling misaligned, read the past 2-4 weeks. The pattern will be obvious.
