# Memory — Pattern Tracking Across Years

This file is your **long-term memory** — a place to track patterns, insights, and lessons that emerge across months and years.

**Why this matters:**
- Patterns repeat until you name them
- Unnamed insights disappear
- This file prevents you from relearning the same lesson every year

---

## How to Use This File

1. **After each Annual Review**, add key insights, patterns, or lessons to this file
2. **After uploading past documents** (annual reviews, notes, etc.), summarize recurring themes here
3. **Reference this file** when doing quarterly or annual reviews to see if patterns are still active
4. **Update it when patterns shift** — if you finally break a pattern, note that too

## Template for Adding Patterns

Use this structure when adding new entries:

**[DATE] — [PATTERN OR INSIGHT TITLE]**

**What I noticed:**
[Description of the pattern, insight, or lesson]

**Where this showed up:**
[Specific examples — annual reviews, quarterly reviews, life events, etc.]

**Root cause (if known):**
[What's actually driving this pattern?]

**Status:**
- [ ] Still active (pattern repeating)
- [ ] Partially addressed (making progress)
- [ ] Resolved (pattern broken)

**Next action (if applicable):**
[What you're committing to do about this]

## Example Entry

**2025-01-10 — I keep saying I'll prioritize health but don't**

**What I noticed:**
For the past three annual reviews (2022, 2023, 2024), I've set a goal to "get in shape" or "exercise consistently." Each year, I start strong in January, then drop off by March. By the end of the year, my health rating in the Life Map is consistently 4-5/10.

**Where this showed up:**
- 2022 Annual Review: "I want to lose 15 pounds and work out 3x/week"
- 2023 Annual Review: "This year I'll finally prioritize my health"
- 2024 Annual Review: "I need to get back in shape — this is non-negotiable"
- 2025 Q1 Review: Still haven't built the habit

**Root cause (if known):**
I treat exercise as optional, not essential. When work gets busy (which it always does), exercise is the first thing to drop. I also don't have a system — I rely on willpower, which fails under stress.

**Status:**
- [x] Still active (pattern repeating)

**Next action:**
- Hire a personal trainer (accountability + system)
- Block 7-8 AM for exercise, treat it like a meeting
- Track this in quarterly reviews to ensure it doesn't slip again

## Your Patterns

*Add your patterns below using the template above.*

---

### Recurring Goals (Goals That Repeat But Don't Get Pursued)

**Pattern:**
[What goal keeps showing up year after year without progress?]

**Years observed:**
[e.g., 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025]

**Why it's not happening:**
[Be honest. Wrong goal? Fear? Lack of commitment? Misalignment?]

**Resolution:**
[Either commit fully with a real plan, or delete the goal and stop lying to yourself]

---

### Repeated Mistakes or Blind Spots

**Pattern:**
[What mistake or blind spot keeps appearing in feedback or reflection?]

**Examples:**
[Specific instances where this showed up]

**Cost of this pattern:**
[What has this cost you in relationships, opportunities, energy, or time?]

**What would break this pattern:**
[Coaching? A hard conversation? A boundary? A system change?]

---

### Energy Drains (Things That Consistently Drain You)

**Pattern:**
[What consistently drains you, even when it "should" energize you?]

**Examples:**
[Specific activities, roles, relationships, or projects]

**Why I keep doing this:**
[Obligation? Guilt? Avoidance? Identity?]

**What I need to delegate, eliminate, or redesign:**
[Be specific]

---

### Strengths I Underutilize

**Pattern:**
[What strength do you acknowledge but don't actually leverage?]

**Evidence:**
[Where has this strength shown up successfully?]

**Why I'm not leaning into this more:**
[Fear? Impostor syndrome? Lack of opportunity?]

**How I could leverage this more:**
[Specific ways to deploy this strength]

---

### Relationship Patterns

**Pattern:**
[What relationship pattern keeps repeating?]

**Examples:**
[Specific relationships where this showed up]

**What I contribute to this pattern:**
[Your role in creating or maintaining it]

**What would change this:**
[A conversation? A boundary? Therapy? Letting go?]

---

### Decision-Making Patterns

**Pattern:**
[What pattern shows up in how you make (or avoid) decisions?]

**Examples:**
[Specific decisions where this pattern was active]

**Cost of this pattern:**
[What has this cost you?]

**What would improve this:**
[Better frameworks? More input? Trusting your gut? Slowing down? Speeding up?]

---

### Values Misalignments

**Pattern:**
[Where do your stated values and actual behavior diverge?]

**Evidence:**
[Specific examples of the gap]

**Why the gap exists:**
[Fear? External pressure? Unclear priorities?]

**What closing this gap would require:**
[Hard conversations? Quitting? Saying no? Changing jobs?]

---

## Patterns That Have Been Resolved

*When you break a pattern, move it here and document what changed.*

**Example:**

**Pattern:** I used to avoid hard conversations, letting resentment build until relationships exploded.

**What broke the pattern:** I hired a coach who taught me to address issues within 48 hours. I practiced with low-stakes conversations first, then applied it to high-stakes ones.

**Evidence it's resolved:** I had three difficult conversations this year (with a co-founder, an underperforming employee, and my partner) and all of them strengthened the relationship instead of destroying it.

**Date resolved:** 2024-06-15

## Insights from Uploaded Documents

*If you've uploaded past annual reviews, notes, or documents (see `/uploads/`), summarize key insights here.*

**Document:** [Name of document, e.g., "2020-2023 Annual Reviews"]

**Key insights:**

1. [Insight or pattern]
2. [Insight or pattern]
3. [Insight or pattern]

**What this tells me:**
[Summary of what these patterns reveal about you, your work, or your life]

---

## Executive Pattern Summary (Updated Annually)

*After each Annual Review, write a 1-2 paragraph summary of the most important patterns you're tracking.*

**[YEAR] Summary:**

[YOUR SUMMARY — e.g., "The clearest pattern this year is that I keep sacrificing health and relationships for professional growth, even though my stated values say family and well-being are non-negotiable. This misalignment is costing me energy, joy, and trust with the people I care about. Until I address this, no amount of professional success will feel fulfilling."]

## Final Note

This file is not a performance document.

It's a truth document.

The patterns you track here are the difference between learning and repeating.

If you keep writing the same pattern year after year without addressing it, that's data.

Either the pattern is acceptable (in which case, stop calling it a problem), or it's not (in which case, do something about it).

The middle ground — acknowledging the pattern but not acting — is where years disappear.

Don't let that be you.
