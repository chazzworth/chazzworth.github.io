# Ideal Lifestyle Costing Framework

**Based on Tim Ferriss's "Dreamlining" concept from The 4-Hour Workweek**

This framework helps you calculate what your ideal life actually costs — and realize it's usually far less than you think.

---

## What This Framework Does

Most people:
- Assume their dream life costs millions
- Work toward vague financial goals ("wealth," "success," "financial freedom")
- Realize too late that they're chasing a number with no meaning

**This framework flips that.**

Instead of asking *"How much money do I need?"*, you ask:

**"What do I actually want to do, be, and have — and what does that cost per month?"**

**Why this matters:**
- You may already be able to afford your ideal life (or be closer than you think)
- Knowing the real number removes anxiety and endless striving
- You can make decisions based on **sufficiency**, not scarcity

**Time required:** 30-60 minutes

**Best timing:** After writing your Vivid Vision, before setting financial goals

## How to Calculate Your Ideal Lifestyle Cost

### Step 1: Define Your Ideal Lifestyle in Concrete Terms

Don't think about money yet. Think about **what you actually want to do, be, and have.**

Break it into three categories:

---

#### **BEING** (Who You Want to Be)

*What skills, qualities, or identities do you want to embody?*

Examples:
- Fluent in Spanish
- In the best shape of my life
- A present, engaged parent
- A confident public speaker
- A published author

**List 3-5 "being" goals:**

1. [e.g., Physically strong and healthy]
2. [e.g., Financially literate and confident]
3. [e.g., A calm, grounded leader]
4. [e.g., A skilled [hobby/craft]]
5. [Optional fifth]

---

#### **DOING** (Experiences You Want to Have)

*What do you want to experience regularly or once?*

**Regular experiences** (monthly or quarterly):
- Weekly date nights with my partner
- Monthly dinners with close friends
- Quarterly weekend trips to [LOCATION]
- Weekly [hobby — e.g., golf, pottery, surfing]

**One-time experiences** (bucket list):
- Three-week trip to Japan
- Learn to fly a plane
- Attend [EVENT — e.g., Formula 1 race, music festival, retreat]
- Sabbatical for three months

**List 5-10 experiences:**

1. [e.g., Annual two-week family vacation to Europe]
2. [e.g., Monthly massage or wellness treatment]
3. [e.g., Quarterly weekend getaway with my partner]
4. [e.g., Weekly personal training sessions]
5. [e.g., One-time: three-month sabbatical in [LOCATION]]
6. [Add more as needed]

---

#### **HAVING** (Things You Want to Own or Access)

*What physical things or resources would improve your life?*

**Not luxury for luxury's sake — but things that genuinely matter.**

Examples:
- A home office with great light and ergonomic setup
- A car that's reliable and enjoyable to drive
- High-quality health insurance
- Access to a personal trainer or coach
- A wardrobe of clothes that fit well and feel good
- A vacation home or regular access to nature

**List 5-10 material things:**

1. [e.g., A comfortable, well-designed home in [LOCATION]]
2. [e.g., A reliable car (specific model or type)]
3. [e.g., High-quality health insurance for my family]
4. [e.g., A home gym setup]
5. [e.g., [Other items that genuinely matter to you]]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the Monthly Cost

Now put a realistic price tag on each item.

**For "being" goals:**
- What would it cost to achieve this? (Courses, coaching, time investment)
- Example: "Fluent in Spanish" = $200/month for tutoring for 12 months = $2,400 total, or ~$200/month

**For "doing" goals (regular experiences):**
- What's the monthly cost?
- Example: "Weekly date nights" = $100/week × 4 = $400/month
- Example: "Quarterly weekend trips" = $1,500/quarter ÷ 3 months = $500/month

**For "doing" goals (one-time experiences):**
- Amortize over 12 months (or however long you're planning for)
- Example: "Three-week Japan trip" = $10,000 total ÷ 12 months = ~$833/month

**For "having" goals:**
- What's the monthly cost (rent, mortgage, subscriptions, maintenance)?
- Example: "Home in [CITY]" = $4,000/month mortgage/rent
- Example: "Reliable car" = $600/month (payment + insurance + gas)

---

### Step 3: Add It All Up

**Total Monthly Cost of Ideal Lifestyle:**

| Category | Item | Monthly Cost |
|----------|------|--------------|
| Being | [e.g., Spanish lessons] | $200 |
| Being | [e.g., Personal trainer] | $400 |
| Doing | [e.g., Weekly date nights] | $400 |
| Doing | [e.g., Quarterly trips] | $500 |
| Doing | [e.g., Annual Japan trip, amortized] | $833 |
| Having | [e.g., Home mortgage/rent] | $4,000 |
| Having | [e.g., Car payment + insurance] | $600 |
| Having | [e.g., Health insurance] | $800 |
| Doing | [e.g., Monthly massage] | $200 |
| Having | [e.g., Wardrobe refresh, amortized] | $150 |
| **TOTAL** | | **$8,083/month** |

**Annualized:** $8,083 × 12 = **~$97,000/year**

---

### Step 4: Compare to Your Current Reality

**What are you currently earning (personally, not company revenue)?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**What's the gap?**

- If you're already above the number: **You can afford your ideal life now.** What's stopping you?
- If you're below the number: **How far below?** Is it a 20% gap or a 300% gap?

**Critical insight:** Most people discover their ideal life costs 30-50% less than they assumed.

---

### Step 5: Reality Check Questions

**Does this budget include:**
- Housing (mortgage/rent)
- Utilities, food, basic living expenses
- Health insurance
- Savings/investments (e.g., 10-20% of income)
- Taxes (depending on your country/state)

**If not, add them now.** The goal is a **realistic, complete picture**.

**Revised total monthly cost (including basics):**

[YOUR UPDATED NUMBER]

**Revised annual cost:**

[YOUR ANNUAL NUMBER]

---

## What to Do With This Information

### If You're Already Above the Number:

**You've won the game financially.**

The question is no longer *"How do I make more money?"*

The question is: **"Why am I not living this life yet?"**

Possible reasons:
- You're deferring happiness to some imaginary future milestone
- You're optimizing for status or external validation, not actual satisfaction
- You're afraid to claim the life you've already earned
- You're working toward goals that don't actually align with this vision

**Action step:** Start living the life now. Book the trip. Hire the trainer. Take the sabbatical. You can afford it.

---

### If You're Below the Number (But Close):

**You're 1-2 strategic moves away.**

Possible paths:
- Increase your income by 20-30% (promotion, raise, new role, pricing increase)
- Reduce other expenses by 10-20% (cut what doesn't align with the vision)
- Delay one-time experiences by 6-12 months while you close the gap

**Action step:** Identify the **single highest-leverage move** to close the gap. Focus there.

---

### If You're Far Below the Number:

**You need a bigger shift.**

Possible paths:
- Change careers or industries (if current trajectory won't get you there)
- Build equity in a business (instead of trading time for money)
- Redesign the vision to focus on what matters most (maybe the $10K trip isn't essential, but the weekly date nights are)

**Action step:** Get honest about whether your current path leads to this lifestyle. If not, what needs to change?

---

## Common Mistakes

**Confusing "ideal life" with "luxury fantasy."**
→ If your list includes a private jet and a yacht, but you've never been on either and don't actually care about them, you're designing someone else's dream.

**Underestimating the cost of basics.**
→ Don't forget taxes, insurance, savings, and basic living expenses. The ideal lifestyle budget should be **on top of** those, not instead of.

**Overestimating the cost of experiences.**
→ That dream trip might cost $10K, not $50K. That monthly massage is $150, not $500. Do the research.

**Assuming "more is better."**
→ Lifestyle inflation is real. The goal is **sufficiency**, not excess.

---

## Integration with Other Frameworks

**After calculating your Ideal Lifestyle Cost:**

1. **Compare it to your Vivid Vision** — Does the vision match the cost? If you're envisioning a $500K/year lifestyle but only calculated $100K, something's off.
2. **Update your financial goals in `/goals/`** — Now you have a real target, not a vague aspiration.
3. **Revisit quarterly** — As your life changes, so does the cost. Recalculate once a year.

---

## Final Note

This exercise is **not about limiting your ambition.**

It's about **removing the anxiety of infinite striving.**

If you know your ideal life costs $120K/year and you're earning $150K, you've already won.

The extra $30K can go to savings, generosity, or optionality — but you're no longer chasing an invisible finish line.

That clarity changes everything.

Most people spend their lives climbing a ladder, only to realize it was leaning against the wrong wall.

This framework makes sure your ladder is against **your** wall.
