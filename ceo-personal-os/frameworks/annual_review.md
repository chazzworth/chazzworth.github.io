# Annual Review Framework

**Based on Dr. Anthony Gustin's Annual Review approach**

This framework helps you systematically reflect on the past year and design the next one with intention.

---

## What This Framework Does

The Annual Review is a structured reflection process that helps you:

1. **Acknowledge what actually happened** (not what you wish happened)
2. **Extract lessons** from both wins and losses
3. **Identify patterns** that keep repeating
4. **Set intentions** for the next year based on truth, not optimism

**Time required:** 3-4 hours (block a full morning without interruptions)

**Best timing:** Late December or early January, when you have mental space

## The Core Questions

### Part 1: What Happened (The Facts)

Start with the objective reality of the past year, before analyzing or judging it.

**Key milestones:**
- What were the 3-5 most significant events of the year (professional and personal)?
- What changed in your business, role, or life circumstances?
- What big decisions did you make?

**Numbers that matter:**
- Revenue / profitability / growth (if applicable)
- Team size and changes
- Personal health markers (weight, fitness, sleep quality, energy levels)
- Relationship quality (time with family, close friends, partner)

---

### Part 2: Highlights (What Worked)

**Professional wins:**
- What worked better than expected?
- What decision are you most proud of?
- What strength did you lean into successfully?

**Personal wins:**
- What brought you the most joy?
- When did you feel most alive?
- What habit or change stuck?

**Relationships:**
- Who did you get closer to?
- What conversation or moment deepened a relationship?

**Energy & fulfillment:**
- What activities consistently energized you?
- When were you in flow state?

---

### Part 3: Lowlights (What Didn't Work)

**This is not a failure list. This is a learning list.**

**Professional struggles:**
- What didn't work as expected?
- Where did you waste time or energy?
- What should you have done differently?

**Personal struggles:**
- What drained you consistently?
- What habit did you fail to build (or break)?
- Where did you compromise your values?

**Relationships:**
- Who did you grow distant from?
- What conflict went unresolved?
- Where did you show up poorly?

**Energy & misalignment:**
- What consistently drained you, even when it "should" have energized you?
- What kept you from feeling fulfilled, even when you were achieving?

---

### Part 4: Lessons Learned

For each lowlight, ask:

**What was the real issue?**
- Was it a skill gap? (Learn)
- A values misalignment? (Change course)
- A capacity issue? (Delegate or eliminate)
- A timing problem? (Revisit later)

**What would you do differently?**

**What pattern does this reveal?**
- Is this the first time this issue showed up, or has it repeated for years?
- If it's repeated: Why? What's the root cause you haven't addressed?

---

### Part 5: What to Carry Forward

**What stays:**
- Which habits, practices, or routines are non-negotiable going into next year?
- Which relationships need continued investment?
- Which professional strengths should you lean into more?

**What stops:**
- What will you explicitly NOT do next year?
- What drains you without sufficient return?
- What worked once but is now over?

---

### Part 6: Themes and Patterns

Look at your past 2-3 years (if you have past reviews or notes).

**What keeps showing up?**
- Goals you set but don't pursue?
- Problems you name but don't solve?
- Strengths you acknowledge but don't leverage?
- Misalignments you tolerate but don't address?

**Critical question:** If this pattern repeats for another 10 years, what's the cumulative cost?

---

### Part 7: The Year Ahead (High-Level Intent)

**Don't set goals yet.** First, define the **theme** of the year.

**If this year had a single focus, what would it be?**

Examples:
- "The year of building a real leadership team"
- "The year of health and energy optimization"
- "The year of deciding what I actually want to build"
- "The year of margin and spaciousness"

**What would make this year feel successful, regardless of external metrics?**

[This is different from revenue goals or milestones — this is about how you want to **feel** at the end of the year.]

---

### Part 8: Integration Questions

**What surprised you most when reviewing the year?**

**What are you avoiding acknowledging?**

**If you could give your past self one piece of advice at the start of last year, what would it be?**

**What would your "personal board of directors" say about how you spent this year?**

---

## How to Use This Framework

1. **Block 3-4 hours of uninterrupted time** (ideally a full morning)
2. **Create a new file** in `/reviews/annual/` named `YYYY_annual_review.md`
3. **Work through each section honestly** — write as much or as little as serves you
4. **Don't perform.** No one will read this but you.
5. **After completing the review:**
   - Update your `north_star.md` if your values or mission have shifted
   - Set your 1-year, 3-year, and 10-year goals in `/goals/`
   - Add key patterns to `memory.md` so you track them over time

---

## Common Mistakes

**Writing what sounds good instead of what's true.**
→ This defeats the entire purpose. Honesty is the only thing that matters.

**Skipping the lowlights because they feel bad.**
→ The failures teach more than the wins. Don't skip them.

**Setting goals before reflecting.**
→ Goals without reflection are just optimism. Reflect first, then set goals.

**Comparing yourself to others.**
→ This is **your** review. Not your competitors', not your peers', not some idealized version of success.

---

## Output: What You Should Have After This

- A clear narrative of the past year (what happened and why)
- A list of lessons learned (what worked, what didn't, what to change)
- A theme or focus for the year ahead
- Patterns identified (so you stop repeating them unconsciously)
- Updated goals and North Star (if needed)

## Final Note

The Annual Review is the backbone of this system.

Everything else — daily check-ins, weekly reviews, quarterly recalibrations — exists to support the insights you surface here.

Do this once a year, with full attention.

The clarity you gain will shape the next 12 months.
