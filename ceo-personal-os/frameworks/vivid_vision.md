# Vivid Vision Framework

**Based on Tony Robbins-style future pacing and Cameron Herold's Vivid Vision concept**

This framework helps you design your ideal future with emotional clarity, not just logical goals.

---

## What This Framework Does

Most goal-setting focuses on **what** you want to achieve (revenue, exits, titles).

Vivid Vision focuses on **how you want to feel** and **what you want your life to look like** when you get there.

**Why this matters:**
- Goals without emotional clarity feel empty when achieved
- You can hit every milestone and still feel misaligned
- Your brain is motivated by **vivid emotional futures**, not spreadsheets

**Time required:** 60-90 minutes of focused writing

**Best timing:** Once per year, after your Annual Review

---

## The Core Idea

Write a detailed, present-tense description of your ideal future **as if it's already happening**.

Not "I will build a company," but **"I'm running a company that..."**

Not "I want to feel energized," but **"I wake up energized because..."**

The more sensory detail, the better. Your brain needs to **see, feel, and believe** the future to move toward it.

---

## How to Write Your Vivid Vision

### Step 1: Choose Your Time Horizon

Pick one:
- **3 years from now** (realistic but ambitious)
- **5 years from now** (longer runway, bigger shifts)
- **10 years from now** (true transformation)

**For most CEOs, 3 years is the sweet spot.** Far enough to imagine real change, close enough to feel actionable.

---

### Step 2: Write in Present Tense, First Person

**Bad example (distant and vague):**
> "In three years, I will have grown the company to $10M ARR and have a better work-life balance."

**Good example (vivid and embodied):**
> "It's Monday morning. I'm sitting in my home office with a coffee, reviewing the week ahead. The company is at $12M ARR, and I'm working 35 hours a week because I have a world-class COO who runs operations. I spend my time on product strategy, coaching my leadership team, and one day a week on deep work. I feel energized, not drained. My calendar has built-in margin. I haven't missed a family dinner in months."

**See the difference?** The second version includes:
- Sensory details (coffee, home office, Monday morning)
- Specific outcomes ($12M, 35-hour weeks)
- Emotional states (energized, not drained)
- Proof points (no missed family dinners)

---

### Step 3: Answer These Prompts in Vivid Detail

**Your Ideal Day (Professional):**

*It's [day of the week], [time of day]. Describe a typical workday in your ideal future.*

- Where are you working? (Home office, co-working space, office building?)
- What's the first thing you do when you sit down to work?
- Who are you meeting with? What kind of conversations are you having?
- What problems are you solving? (Strategic? Creative? People-related?)
- How many hours are you working? What does your energy feel like at the end of the day?

**Your Ideal Day (Personal):**

*What does a perfect Saturday look like in your ideal future?*

- How do you wake up? (Rushed? Rested? What time?)
- Who are you spending time with?
- What are you doing for fun, health, connection?
- How do you feel at the end of the day?

**Your Business / Work:**

*Describe your company or role in vivid detail.*

- What does the business do? Who does it serve?
- How big is the team? What's the culture like?
- What's your role? (Are you CEO, or have you stepped back? Are you building, advising, investing?)
- What metrics matter? (Revenue, profitability, impact, team happiness?)
- What does success look like — not to investors or the market, but to **you**?

**Your Relationships:**

*Describe your closest relationships in your ideal future.*

- Who are you spending the most time with?
- What's the quality of those relationships? (Deep? Superficial? Energizing?)
- How present are you with your partner, kids, close friends?
- What do the people closest to you say about you?

**Your Health & Energy:**

*What does your health and energy look like in your ideal future?*

- What's your morning routine?
- How often are you exercising? What kind of movement?
- How's your sleep? Your stress levels?
- What does your body feel like? (Strong? Flexible? Pain-free?)
- How much energy do you have at 3 PM on a Tuesday?

**Your Financial Reality:**

*Describe your financial situation with clarity.*

- What's your annual income? (Personal, not just company revenue)
- What's your net worth? (Rough target is fine)
- How much do you need to live your ideal lifestyle? (Reference: Ideal Lifestyle Costing)
- Are you financially independent? Wealthy? Comfortable?
- What does money enable in your life? (Freedom? Security? Generosity? Optionality?)

**Your Legacy:**

*If someone wrote about you in this future, what would they say?*

- What are you known for?
- What impact have you had?
- What do the people you've led or worked with say about you?
- What do your kids (if applicable) say about you?

## Example Vivid Vision Excerpt

Here's a real example of what this looks like in practice:

---

**It's Tuesday, 9 AM, January 2028.**

I'm sitting in my home office in [CITY], looking out at [SCENERY — e.g., the mountains, the garden, the city skyline]. I've just finished a 45-minute workout and a quiet breakfast with my partner. No rushing. No phone.

The company is at $15M ARR with a team of 40. I'm CEO, but I'm not managing operations — that's [COO NAME OR "my COO"], who's exceptional. I spend my time on:
- Product vision (where we're going, what we're building)
- Strategic partnerships (high-leverage relationships)
- Coaching the leadership team (helping them grow, not micromanaging)
- Writing and thinking (one deep work day per week, no meetings)

I work 30-35 hours a week. My calendar has margin. I say no to most things.

The business is profitable, not venture-funded. We're not chasing growth for growth's sake — we're building something that matters, sustainably. The team is happy. Turnover is low. People stay because they believe in the work, not because of compensation packages.

I haven't missed a family dinner in six months. My kids know I'm present. My partner and I take a two-week vacation every quarter with no laptop.

Financially, we're secure. I'm earning [AMOUNT] per year. Our net worth is [AMOUNT]. We're not living extravagantly, but we're not stressed about money. If the business disappeared tomorrow, we'd be fine for years.

I feel energized most days. I'm not grinding. I'm building something I'm proud of, with people I respect, in a way that doesn't destroy my health or relationships.

When I reflect on the last three years, I'm proud of what we've built — not just the company, but the **way** we built it.

That's success.

---

**See how specific that is?** That's the level of detail you're aiming for.

---

## How to Use This Framework

1. **Set aside 90 minutes** in a quiet space where you won't be interrupted
2. **Create a new file** in `/goals/` called `vivid_vision_[YEAR].md`
3. **Write freely** — don't edit yourself, just describe the future you actually want
4. **Be honest** — if you don't actually want to run a 500-person company, don't write that
5. **Make it visceral** — use sensory details, emotions, specific scenarios
6. **Read it quarterly** — Does this still feel true? Adjust as needed.

---

## Common Mistakes

**Writing what sounds impressive instead of what you actually want.**
→ If your Vivid Vision feels like a LinkedIn post, start over.

**Being vague.**
→ "I want to be successful and happy" tells you nothing. "I'm running a $10M company, working 30 hours a week, and haven't missed a kid's soccer game in a year" is actionable.

**Ignoring the personal side.**
→ Your Vivid Vision should include **work and life**. If it's all professional, you'll achieve the goals and still feel empty.

**Writing a fantasy instead of a vision.**
→ "I'm a billionaire with a private island" is fine if it's true. But if it's not what you actually want, it's just noise.

## Integration with Other Frameworks

**After writing your Vivid Vision:**

1. **Use Ideal Lifestyle Costing** (see `ideal_life_costing.md`) to calculate what this vision actually costs
2. **Set 1-year, 3-year, and 10-year goals** that move you toward this vision
3. **Update your North Star** to reflect any shifts in values or mission
4. **Reference this vision in your Quarterly Reviews** — Are you moving toward it, or away?

---

## Final Note

Your Vivid Vision is a **North Star**, not a contract.

It will evolve as you do. That's fine.

The goal is not to predict the future perfectly.

The goal is to give your brain a **clear, emotionally compelling direction** to move toward.

Without a Vivid Vision, you're optimizing blindly.

With one, every decision gets easier: **Does this move me toward the vision, or away from it?**

That's the whole value.
