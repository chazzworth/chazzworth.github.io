# Life Map Framework

**Based on Alex Lieberman's Life Map concept**

This framework helps you assess satisfaction across six core life domains and identify where misalignment lives.

---

## What This Framework Does

You can be wildly successful in one area (e.g., career) and deeply misaligned in others (e.g., health, relationships).

**The Life Map forces you to look at the whole picture.**

It tracks satisfaction across six domains:
1. **Career** — Your work, business, professional identity
2. **Relationships** — Partner, family, close friends
3. **Health** — Physical fitness, energy, mental well-being
4. **Meaning** — Purpose, contribution, legacy
5. **Finances** — Earning, saving, financial security
6. **Fun** — Joy, play, hobbies, experiences

**Why this matters:**
- High performers often optimize one domain at the expense of others
- Ignoring a domain doesn't make it disappear — it creates long-term misery
- Balance isn't about equal effort; it's about **intentional allocation**

**Time required:** 15-30 minutes

**Best timing:** Quarterly, as part of your Quarterly Review

## How to Use the Life Map

### Step 1: Rate Each Domain (1-10)

For each of the six domains, rate your **current satisfaction** on a scale of 1-10.

**10 = Deeply satisfied, aligned, energized**
**1 = Miserable, misaligned, draining**

Be honest. This is for you, not for performance.

### **1. Career**

*Your work, business, professional identity, and daily contribution*

**Current rating: ___ / 10**

**What's working:**
- [e.g., I'm energized by the problems I'm solving]
- [e.g., I respect my team and enjoy working with them]
- [e.g., The work feels meaningful]

**What's not working:**
- [e.g., I'm spread too thin across too many priorities]
- [e.g., I'm doing work I've outgrown]
- [e.g., I don't have a clear vision for the next 2-3 years]

**What would move this to a 9 or 10?**

## Step 2: Visualize Your Life Map

Plot your scores on a simple 1-10 scale:

```
Career:         |-------|----X---|        (7/10)
Relationships:  |----X--|--------|        (4/10)
Health:         |-------X--------|        (8/10)
Meaning:        |---X---|--------|        (5/10)
Finances:       |----------|--X--|        (9/10)
Fun:            |-X------|--------|        (2/10)
```

**What patterns do you see?**

- Are you over-indexed on one domain (e.g., career) at the expense of others?
- Is there a domain you've been ignoring for years?
- Which domain, if improved, would have the biggest impact on your overall satisfaction?

---

## Step 3: Identify the Highest-Leverage Domain

**If you could only improve ONE domain in the next 90 days, which would create the most overall life satisfaction?**

This is not always the lowest-scoring domain.

Examples:
- If Relationships is at 4/10, improving it might unlock energy and clarity that helps Career too
- If Health is at 5/10, fixing it might give you the energy to improve everything else
- If Fun is at 2/10, adding play back into your life might reduce burnout and improve performance

**Your highest-leverage domain:**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**What's one concrete action you could take in the next 7 days to improve it?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

---

## Step 4: Set Intentional Boundaries

High performers often **unconsciously sacrifice low-scoring domains** to protect high-scoring ones.

Examples:
- "I'll focus on relationships once the company is stable" (it never is)
- "I'll get healthy after this fundraise" (the next one is already starting)
- "I'll have fun when I'm less busy" (you won't be)

**What domain are you unconsciously sacrificing?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**What would it cost you if this domain stayed at this level for 10 more years?**

[YOUR ANSWER — This is the regret minimization test. Imagine yourself at 80, looking back. What will you wish you'd prioritized?]

---

## Step 5: Define "Good Enough" for Each Domain

You **cannot** maximize all six domains at once.

The goal is **intentional allocation**, not perfect balance.

For each domain, define what "good enough" looks like **right now** (this will change over time).

**Career: Good enough = [e.g., 7/10 — I'm engaged, learning, and contributing, but I'm not sacrificing everything else for it]**

**Relationships: Good enough = [e.g., 8/10 — I'm present, connected, and intentional with the people I love]**

**Health: Good enough = [e.g., 7/10 — I'm exercising 3x/week, sleeping well, and have good energy]**

**Meaning: Good enough = [e.g., 6/10 — I know my work matters, even if I'm not changing the world]**

**Finances: Good enough = [e.g., 8/10 — I'm earning enough to live comfortably and save consistently]**

**Fun: Good enough = [e.g., 5/10 — I have one hobby I do weekly and take one trip per quarter]**

**Reality check:** If "good enough" for Career is 10/10 and everything else is 5/10, you're optimizing for burnout.

---

## How Often to Use This

**Quarterly:** Update your Life Map as part of your Quarterly Review
- Track whether scores are improving, declining, or staying flat
- Notice which domains you keep ignoring
- Adjust your focus for the next 90 days

**Annually:** Compare your Life Map year-over-year
- Are you trending upward overall, or just shifting dissatisfaction between domains?
- What patterns repeat?
- What domain have you been "meaning to fix" for years?

---

## Common Patterns to Watch For

**The "Someday" Trap:**
- Relationships at 4/10: "I'll focus on this after the exit"
- Health at 3/10: "I'll get in shape when things calm down"
- Fun at 2/10: "I'll take a vacation when I have time"

**Someday never comes.** If a domain has been low for 2+ years, it's not a timing issue — it's a values misalignment.

**The "Everything is Fine" Lie:**
- All domains at 6-7/10, nothing at 9-10
- You're not failing anywhere, but you're not thriving anywhere either
- This often signals **lack of intentionality** — you're coasting instead of designing

**The Burnout Formula:**
- Career at 9/10, everything else at 3-5/10
- You're succeeding professionally and failing personally
- This works for 1-2 years max. After that, it collapses.

**The "Meaning Crisis" Signal:**
- All practical domains are high (Career, Finances, Health), but Meaning is low
- You're achieving, but it feels hollow
- This is often a signal to revisit your North Star and Vivid Vision

---

## Integration with Other Frameworks

**After completing your Life Map:**

1. **Compare to your North Star** — Do your actual satisfaction levels reflect your stated values?
2. **Compare to your Vivid Vision** — Is your current Life Map moving you toward that future, or away from it?
3. **Set quarterly priorities** — Which domain needs focus in the next 90 days?

---

## Final Note

The Life Map is not about achieving perfect 10s in all six domains.

That's impossible, and it's not the goal.

The goal is **intentional allocation** — knowing where you're over-indexed, where you're neglecting, and **whether that's on purpose or by accident**.

If you're at Career 9/10 and Relationships 4/10, and that's **intentional** (e.g., you're in a 6-month sprint before selling the company), fine.

But if it's **unconscious** — if you're sacrificing relationships without realizing it — the Life Map surfaces that misalignment.

Once you see it, you can decide.

And deciding is the whole game.
