# North Star

Your personal mission, values, and non-negotiables.

This is the anchor. When you're making hard decisions or feeling misaligned, come back to this.

**You don't need to fill this out perfectly right now.** Clarity emerges through reflection, not pressure.

Start with what you know. Revise as you learn.

## Personal Mission (One Sentence)

*What is the work only you can do in the world?*

**My mission is:**

[YOUR ANSWER — e.g., "To build companies that create meaningful work for others" or "To help founders avoid the mistakes I made" or "To live fully and leave my family secure"]

---

## Core Values (3-5 Maximum)

These are the principles you will not compromise, even under pressure.

1. [e.g., Integrity — I keep my word, even when it's inconvenient]
2. [e.g., Family first — No amount of professional success justifies sacrificing my relationships]
3. [e.g., Craft — I care about the quality of my work, not just the outcomes]
4. [e.g., Freedom — I design my life around autonomy, not external validation]
5. [Optional fifth value]

## Non-Negotiables

These are the boundaries you will enforce, no matter what.

**Health:**
- [e.g., I will not skip exercise for back-to-back meetings]
- [e.g., I will not work past 7 PM on weeknights]

**Relationships:**
- [e.g., I will not miss my kid's bedtime without a critical reason]
- [e.g., I will protect date night, even during busy seasons]

**Work:**

## Regret Minimization Test

**At age 80, looking back, what would you regret NOT doing?**

[YOUR ANSWER — This is the Jeff Bezos-style framing: imagine yourself old, reflecting on your life. What would hurt to have missed?]

Example answers:
- "Not starting the company I've been thinking about for years"
- "Not spending more time with my kids while they were young"
- "Not taking the sabbatical when I had the chance"
- "Playing it safe when I could have taken the risk"

## What Energizes You (Even When It's Hard)

*These are the activities that drain your time but fill your energy.*

[YOUR ANSWER — e.g., "Whiteboarding strategy with my co-founder," "Coaching junior team members," "Writing long-form essays," "Building products from scratch"]

---

## What Drains You (Even When It "Should" Energize You)

*These are the things that look good on paper but leave you empty.*

[YOUR ANSWER — e.g., "Networking events," "Fundraising meetings," "Optimizing operational details," "Managing underperformers"]

**Critical insight:** If something consistently drains you, it either needs to be delegated, redesigned, or eliminated. High performers are honest about this.

## Your Ideal Calendar (One Perfect Week)

If you could design a single week that, repeated 50 times, would create your ideal year — what does it look like?

**Monday:**
- [e.g., 7-9 AM: Deep work (product strategy), 10-12 PM: Leadership team meeting, 1-3 PM: Customer calls, 4-5 PM: Exercise, Evening: Family dinner]

**Tuesday:**
- [Fill in your ideal Tuesday structure]

**Wednesday:**
- [Fill in your ideal Wednesday structure]

**Thursday:**
- [Fill in your ideal Thursday structure]

**Friday:**
- [Fill in your ideal Friday structure]

**Saturday:**
- [Fill in your ideal Saturday structure]

**Sunday:**
- [Fill in your ideal Sunday structure]

**Reality check:** How far is your actual calendar from this? If it's dramatically different, why? Are those misalignments temporary (e.g., fundraising season) or permanent?

---

## Your "Hell Yes" Filter

You will get more opportunities than you can pursue.

Most will sound good. Only some will be **right**.

**I only say yes to opportunities that:**

1. [e.g., Align with my mission to build companies that matter]
2. [e.g., Let me work with people I respect and trust]
3. [e.g., Give me energy, not just money]
4. [e.g., Move me closer to my 10-year vision]

**Everything else is a "not now."**

## Your Personal Board of Directors

If you had a board advising you on your life (not just your company), who would be on it?

These are the 3-5 people whose judgment you trust completely — whose advice you'd actually take.

1. **[Name]** — [Why their perspective matters, e.g., "Built and exited two companies, values family over growth-at-all-costs"]
2. **[Name]** — [Why their perspective matters]
3. **[Name]** — [Why their perspective matters]
4. **[Name]** — [Optional fourth member]
5. **[Name]** — [Optional fifth member]

**How to use this:** When facing a major decision, imagine presenting it to this board. What would they ask? What would concern them? What would they push you to do?

---

## Future Self Check-In

**Imagine yourself 10 years from now, having lived in full alignment with this North Star.**

- What does your life look like?
- How do you spend your days?
- What are you most proud of?
- What did you stop doing that used to consume you?
- What advice would that future self give you today?

[YOUR ANSWER]

## Final Reminder

This is **your** North Star. Not your investors', not your team's, not your family's expectations.

If something on this page feels like it "should" be true but isn't actually true, delete it.

The system only works if you're honest.
