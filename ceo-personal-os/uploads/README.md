# Uploads Directory

This folder is for past documents you want to learn from — annual reviews, performance reviews, personal notes, or any reflections you've written before starting this system.

## Why Upload Past Documents?

**Patterns repeat until you name them.**

If you've been writing annual reviews, journaling, or taking notes for years, those documents contain valuable data:
- Goals you've set repeatedly but never pursued
- Patterns that keep showing up
- Strengths you've acknowledged but not leveraged
- Misalignments you've tolerated but not addressed
- Insights you've forgotten

**Uploading and synthesizing past documents helps you:**
- See what you've been saying for years but not acting on
- Identify blind spots that others have pointed out repeatedly
- Avoid relearning the same lessons every year
- Build a real understanding of your long-term patterns

---

## What to Upload

**Good candidates:**
- Past annual reviews (from any source — work, personal, etc.)
- Performance reviews (from managers, boards, or self-assessments)
- Personal reflections or journals
- Notes from coaching or therapy sessions
- Old goal-setting documents
- Exit interviews or post-mortems
- Letters to yourself from past years

**Not necessary:**
- Random meeting notes or task lists
- Documents that don't contain reflection or insight
- Anything you wouldn't actually reference when thinking about patterns

## How to Upload

1. **Save files in the appropriate subfolder:**
   - `/uploads/past_annual_reviews/` for annual reviews
   - `/uploads/notes/` for journals, reflections, or miscellaneous notes

2. **Use clear file names:**
   - `2020_annual_review.md` or `2020_annual_review.txt`
   - `performance_review_2018.md`
   - `coaching_notes_2022.md`

3. **Convert to plain text or markdown if possible:**
   - This system works best with `.md` or `.txt` files
   - If you have PDFs or Word docs, copy the content into a text file

## What to Do After Uploading

**Don't just drop files here and forget them.** The value is in synthesis.

1. **Read through uploaded documents** (set aside 1-2 hours)
2. **Extract key patterns, themes, and insights**
3. **Summarize them in `memory.md`** (in the root folder)
4. **Use these patterns to inform your current goals and reviews**

---

## Example Synthesis Process

**Step 1: Upload**
- Drop your 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 annual reviews into `/uploads/past_annual_reviews/`

**Step 2: Read and Extract**
- Read all four reviews in one sitting
- Look for:
  - Goals that repeat every year but never get pursued
  - Patterns in what energizes vs. drains you
  - Recurring feedback or blind spots
  - Themes in what you're proud of vs. what you regret

**Step 3: Synthesize in `memory.md`**

Example entry:

> **2025-01-10 — I've been saying "I'll write a book" for 5 years but haven't started**
>
> **What I noticed:**
> In every annual review from 2020-2024, I've listed "write a book" as a goal. I've made zero progress.
>
> **Root cause:**
> I'm waiting for the "right time" or "more clarity." In reality, I'm afraid to start because I'm not sure it will be good enough.
>
> **Status:** Still active
>
> **Next action:** Either commit to writing 500 words/day starting next week, or delete this goal and stop lying to myself.

**Step 4: Reference in Future Reviews**
- When doing quarterly or annual reviews, check `memory.md` to see if patterns are shifting or persisting

## Common Questions

**Do I need to upload documents to use this system?**
No. The system works fine without past documents. But if you have them, they're valuable data.

**What if I don't have past annual reviews?**
That's fine. Start fresh. After a few years of using this system, you'll have your own archive to reference.

**Should I upload every journal entry I've ever written?**
No. Only upload documents that contain insights, patterns, or reflections you'd actually reference. Quality > quantity.

**How often should I review uploaded documents?**
Once per year, during your Annual Review, is enough.

## Final Note

Your past is not a mistake. It's data.

If you've been setting the same goals for five years, that's not failure — it's a signal.

Either the goal is wrong, or the path is wrong, or the commitment is wrong.

Uploading and synthesizing past documents helps you see the signal clearly.

Then you can decide what to do about it.
