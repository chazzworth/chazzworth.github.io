# Past Annual Reviews

Drop past annual reviews here — from work, personal reflections, or previous systems you've used.

## File Naming

Use clear, date-based names:
- `2020_annual_review.md`
- `2021_annual_review.txt`
- `work_performance_review_2022.md`

## After Uploading

1. Read through all past reviews in one sitting
2. Extract recurring patterns, goals, or themes
3. Summarize key insights in `memory.md` (in the root folder)
4. Reference these patterns in your current Annual Review

## What to Look For

- **Goals that repeat** — If you've set the same goal 3+ years in a row, that's a pattern worth examining
- **Energy patterns** — What consistently energizes or drains you across years?
- **Relationship patterns** — Who shows up repeatedly in wins or struggles?
- **Blind spots** — What feedback have you received multiple times but not acted on?
- **Themes** — What's the through-line across multiple years?

**The goal is not to judge your past self. The goal is to learn from them.**
