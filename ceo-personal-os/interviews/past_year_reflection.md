# Past Year Reflection Interview

A guided self-interview to surface insights about the year you just lived.

**Time required:** 60-90 minutes

## Opening Question

**Before we dive into specifics, tell me about the last year in one paragraph. No analysis, no judgment — just what happened.**

[YOUR ANSWER]

---

## Part 1: The Highlights

**Let's start with what worked. What were the three moments or achievements you're most proud of from the past year?**

1.
2.
3.

**Why those three? What made them meaningful?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**When you think about those highlights, what strengths did you lean into?**

[YOUR ANSWER — e.g., strategic thinking, resilience, creativity, leadership, etc.]

**What's one thing you did this year that no one else saw, but you're quietly proud of?**

[YOUR ANSWER — This is the internal win, the decision no one applauds but that mattered deeply to you]

---

## Part 2: The Lowlights

**Now let's talk about what didn't work. What were the three hardest moments or biggest disappointments of the year?**

1.
2.
3.

**Why were those hard? What made them painful or frustrating?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**Looking back, were those failures inevitable, or were they avoidable?**

[YOUR ANSWER — Be honest. If you saw it coming but didn't act, that's useful data.]

**What pattern do you notice in these lowlights? Is there a common thread?**

[YOUR ANSWER — e.g., "I keep overcommitting," "I avoid confrontation until it explodes," "I ignore my health until I crash," etc.]

## Part 3: Energy and Alignment

**What drained you the most this year — even if it "shouldn't" have?**

[YOUR ANSWER — This might be something others love, or something you thought you'd enjoy. If it drained you, it drained you.]

**What energized you the most — even if it seemed unproductive or indulgent?**

[YOUR ANSWER — Pay attention to this. Energy is data.]

**If you could eliminate one thing from this past year — one project, commitment, or relationship — what would it be?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**Why didn't you eliminate it sooner?**

[YOUR ANSWER — Fear of letting people down? Sunk cost fallacy? Avoiding a hard conversation? Be honest.]

**If this year repeated 10 times in a row, would you be satisfied with your life?**

[YOUR ANSWER — This is brutal but clarifying. If the answer is no, what specifically would make it unbearable?]

---

## Part 4: Relationships

**Who did you get closer to this year?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**What made that happen? Was it intentional, or did it just unfold?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**Who did you grow distant from?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**Was that intentional, or did you let it happen by default?**

[YOUR ANSWER — If by default, do you want to change that?]

**If someone close to you — your partner, best friend, or co-founder — wrote an honest review of how you showed up this year, what would they say?**

[YOUR ANSWER — Be real. Not the polite version. The true version.]

**What relationship regret do you carry from this year?**

[YOUR ANSWER — A conversation you didn't have? Time you didn't make? A conflict you avoided?]

---

## Part 5: Work and Impact

**What did you build or contribute this year that you're genuinely proud of?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**What did you work on that, in hindsight, didn't matter?**

[YOUR ANSWER — This is the "busy but not important" work. The stuff that felt urgent but had no real impact.]

**If you removed that low-impact work entirely, what would you have done with the time?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**Did you make progress on the things you said mattered most at the start of the year?**

[YOUR ANSWER — If no, why not? If yes, was it worth it?]

**What decision are you most proud of from this year?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**What decision do you regret most?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**If you could redo one major decision from this year, what would you change?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

## Part 6: Health and Well-Being

**How was your physical health this year?**

[YOUR ANSWER — Energy levels, fitness, sleep, injuries, illnesses, etc.]

**How was your mental health this year?**

[YOUR ANSWER — Stress, anxiety, clarity, joy, burnout, etc.]

**What did you do (or not do) that contributed to your current state of health?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**If your body could talk, what would it say about how you treated it this year?**

[YOUR ANSWER — This sounds abstract, but it's powerful. Listen to what comes up.]

**What self-care practice did you maintain consistently? What did you abandon?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

---

## Part 7: Patterns and Blind Spots

**This is the most important section. Take your time.**

**What goal or intention have you set for multiple years in a row but still haven't acted on?**

[YOUR ANSWER — e.g., "Get in shape," "Hire a COO," "Spend more time with family," "Write the book," etc.]

**Why do you think that pattern repeats?**

[YOUR ANSWER — Fear? Misalignment? Lack of real commitment? Wrong goal?]

**What feedback have you received multiple times from different people?**

[YOUR ANSWER — This is your blind spot. Even if you don't agree with it, it's worth examining.]

**What hard conversation have you been avoiding?**

[YOUR ANSWER — With a co-founder, employee, partner, investor, or yourself?]

**What do you know is true but don't want to admit?**

[YOUR ANSWER — This is the question that matters most. Sit with it. Don't rush.]

## Part 8: What You Learned

**What's the single most important lesson you learned this year?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**What belief or assumption did you hold at the start of the year that turned out to be wrong?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**What strength did you discover or rediscover in yourself?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**What weakness or limitation did you have to confront?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**If you could give your past self (one year ago) one piece of advice, what would it be?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

---

## Part 9: What You're Carrying Forward

**What from this past year do you want to carry into the next year?**

[YOUR ANSWER — Habits, relationships, projects, ways of being, etc.]

**What are you ready to leave behind?**

[YOUR ANSWER — This can be goals, habits, relationships, identities, or ways of working that no longer serve you.]

**What unfinished business are you carrying from this year?**

[YOUR ANSWER — Is it worth finishing, or is it time to let it go?]

---

## Closing Question

**If someone asked you, "How was your year?" — not the polite cocktail-party answer, but the real answer — what would you say?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

---

## What to Do Next

After completing this interview:

1. **Read through your answers slowly.** Notice what surprises you, what stings, what feels true.
2. **Extract 3-5 key insights** — patterns, lessons, or realizations you don't want to forget.
3. **Add those insights to `memory.md`** in the root folder, so you can reference them in future reviews.
4. **Move to your Annual Review** (see `/reviews/annual/` and `/frameworks/annual_review.md`) to set intentions for the next year.

## Final Note

If this interview surfaced pain, conflict, or clarity you weren't expecting — that's the point.

Reflection is not comfortable. It's useful.

The insights you uncover here are worth more than any goal you'll set for next year.

Act on them.
