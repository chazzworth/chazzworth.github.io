# Identity and Values Interview

A guided self-interview to clarify who you are, what you stand for, and what you will not compromise.

**Time required:** 60-90 minutes

**When to use this:** When you're feeling misaligned, making a major life decision, or defining your North Star for the first time

**How to use this:** Read each question slowly. Don't rush to the "right" answer. Write what's true, even if it's uncomfortable or incomplete.

## Opening Question

**If you had to describe yourself in three words — not your title, not your role, but who you are at your core — what would they be?**

1.
2.
3.

[YOUR ANSWER]

## Part 1: Identity (Who You Are)

**Who are you when no one is watching?**

[YOUR ANSWER — Not the curated version. The real version.]

**What do you care about that no one else seems to care about?**

[YOUR ANSWER — This is often a clue to your unique contribution.]

**What part of your identity feels most authentic — the part that never changes, no matter your circumstances?**

[YOUR ANSWER — e.g., "I'm a builder," "I'm a truth-teller," "I'm a protector," "I'm a skeptic," etc.]

**What part of your identity feels performative — the part you've adopted to fit expectations?**

[YOUR ANSWER — This might sting. That's the point.]

**If you could no longer do your current job or hold your current title, who would you be?**

[YOUR ANSWER — This tests whether your identity is tied to external roles or internal values.]

**What do people consistently say about you that feels true?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**What do people consistently say about you that feels inaccurate or incomplete?**

[YOUR ANSWER — This is the gap between how you're perceived and who you actually are.]

## Part 2: Core Values (What You Stand For)

**What principles do you hold, even when they're inconvenient or costly?**

[YOUR ANSWER — e.g., honesty, even when a lie would be easier; loyalty, even when it's unrewarded; craft, even when "good enough" would work]

**Tell me about a time you compromised a value and regretted it. What happened?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**What did that teach you about what matters most?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**If you had to choose three values you will not compromise under any circumstances, what would they be?**

1.
2.
3.

**Why those three?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**What value do you claim to hold but don't actually live by?**

[YOUR ANSWER — This is brutal but clarifying. If you say you value health but skip exercise constantly, that's misalignment.]

---

## Part 3: What You Will Not Tolerate

**What behavior in others is an instant dealbreaker for you?**

[YOUR ANSWER — e.g., dishonesty, cruelty, incompetence disguised as effort, passive aggression, etc.]

**Why is that a dealbreaker? What does it violate in you?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**What situation or environment makes you feel physically uncomfortable or morally compromised?**

[YOUR ANSWER — e.g., working with people you don't respect, meetings with no purpose, being asked to mislead, etc.]

**What are you no longer willing to tolerate in your life?**

[YOUR ANSWER — This can be professional (bad leadership, misaligned teams) or personal (toxic relationships, self-neglect)]

---

## Part 4: What Gives You Meaning

**What work feels meaningful to you, even when it's hard?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**What impact do you want to have on the world — not in grand terms, but in real, specific terms?**

[YOUR ANSWER — e.g., "I want the people I lead to grow into leaders themselves," "I want to build products that solve real problems," "I want my kids to feel secure and loved," etc.]

**When you've felt most purposeful or alive, what were you doing?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**If you could only work on one problem for the rest of your life, what would it be?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**What contribution would you regret not making?**

[YOUR ANSWER — This is the Jeff Bezos regret minimization test applied to meaning.]

## Part 5: What You're Running From

**What are you trying to prove, and to whom?**

[YOUR ANSWER — Be honest. Are you trying to prove you're smart, worthy, successful, different from your parents, deserving of respect?]

**What are you afraid people will discover about you?**

[YOUR ANSWER — The impostor syndrome question. What do you fear being "found out" for?]

**What failure or fear quietly drives many of your decisions?**

[YOUR ANSWER — e.g., fear of being ordinary, fear of financial insecurity, fear of being controlled, fear of irrelevance, etc.]

**If that fear were no longer true — if you had nothing to prove — what would you do differently?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

---

## Part 6: What You're Running Toward

**What does "success" actually mean to you — not the cultural definition, but yours?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**If you achieved that version of success, what would your life look like day-to-day?**

[YOUR ANSWER — Be specific. What time do you wake up? Who are you with? What do you spend your time on?]

**What does "a life well-lived" look like for you?**

[YOUR ANSWER — At 80, looking back, what would make you feel satisfied?]

**What are you optimizing your life for right now?**

[YOUR ANSWER — Be honest. Is it wealth? Status? Freedom? Impact? Family? Craft? Something else?]

**Is that what you actually want to optimize for, or is it what you've defaulted to?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

## Part 7: Your Non-Negotiables

**What boundaries will you enforce, no matter what?**

[YOUR ANSWER — e.g., "I will not work with people I don't respect," "I will not miss bedtime with my kids," "I will not sacrifice my health for short-term gains," etc.]

**What have you said is non-negotiable but keep negotiating anyway?**

[YOUR ANSWER — This is the misalignment alarm.]

**What decision would you make right now if you were truly aligned with your values?**

[YOUR ANSWER — The decision you know you need to make but are avoiding.]

---

## Part 8: Your Personal Operating Principles

**If you were writing a user manual for yourself — "how to work with me" or "how I make decisions" — what would it say?**

[YOUR ANSWER — e.g., "I need time to think before deciding," "I value directness over diplomacy," "I'm energized by deep work, drained by constant interruptions," etc.]

**What conditions do you need to do your best work?**

[YOUR ANSWER — Time of day, environment, types of problems, collaboration style, etc.]

**What conditions make you ineffective or miserable?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**What's your relationship with failure?**

[YOUR ANSWER — Do you see it as data, as shame, as motivation, as evidence you're pushing hard enough?]

**What's your relationship with success?**

[YOUR ANSWER — Do you celebrate it, dismiss it, fear it won't last, move on immediately to the next thing?]

---

## Part 9: Integrity Check

**Where is there a gap between who you say you are and who you actually are?**

[YOUR ANSWER — This is the hardest question in this interview. Sit with it.]

**What would it take to close that gap?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**What are you pretending not to know?**

[YOUR ANSWER — The thing you know is true but don't want to admit. About your work, your relationships, your goals, yourself.]

**If you were being completely honest with yourself, what would you change about your life right now?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

## Part 10: Legacy and Future Self

**How do you want to be remembered by the people closest to you?**

[YOUR ANSWER — Not your public reputation. The people who actually know you.]

**What do you want them to say about how you treated them, how you showed up, what you stood for?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**If your future self — 10 years from now, fully aligned and living with integrity — could speak to you right now, what would they say?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**What advice would they give you?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**What would they tell you to stop doing immediately?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**What would they tell you to start doing, even if it's hard?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

## Closing Questions

**After reflecting on all of this, what's the single most important thing you learned about yourself?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**What truth did you avoid acknowledging until now?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

**What's one decision you need to make based on what you now see clearly?**

[YOUR ANSWER]

---

## What to Do Next

After completing this interview:

1. **Sit with it.** Don't immediately act. Let the insights settle.
2. **Extract 3-5 core values** that feel non-negotiable. Write them in your `north_star.md`.
3. **Identify 1-2 misalignments** that are costing you the most. Decide if you're going to address them or consciously accept them.
4. **Add key insights to `memory.md`** so you remember what you learned here.
5. **Revisit this interview once a year.** Your answers will change. That's the point.

## Final Note

This interview is not therapy. It's structured reflection.

If it surfaced deeper issues — unprocessed trauma, chronic dissatisfaction, existential questions you can't resolve alone — consider finding a coach or therapist.

But if it just surfaced clarity — about who you are, what you value, and what needs to change — that's exactly what it's designed to do.

Now the question is: What will you do with that clarity?
