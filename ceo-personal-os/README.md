# CEO Personal Operating System

A private, single-user productivity system designed for founders, CEOs, and operators who want clarity without complexity.

This is not software. This is a **system** — a thoughtful framework for reflection, goal-setting, and course correction that takes minutes, not hours.

---

## What This System Does

- **Daily Check-ins**: 5-minute reflection on energy, wins, friction, and tomorrow's priority
- **Weekly Reviews**: 15-minute assessment of what moved the needle vs. what was noise
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Strategic pause to evaluate goals, energy, and alignment
- **Annual Reviews**: Deep reflection using proven frameworks from Gustin, Ferriss, Robbins, and Lieberman
- **Guided Interviews**: Self-coaching questions that surface insights you wouldn't find alone
- **Pattern Recognition**: Upload past reviews/notes, extract themes, track what repeats
- **Framework Library**: Proven mental models translated into CEO-friendly language

## How to Use This System (15-Minute Setup)

### First Time Setup

1. **Read `principles.md`** — Understand the philosophy behind this system (3 minutes)
2. **Complete `north_star.md`** — Define your personal mission and non-negotiables (5 minutes)
3. **Choose one interview** in `/interviews` to start with — `identity_and_values.md` is a good first choice (30-60 minutes, do this when you have space to think)
4. **Set your 1-year goals** in `/goals/1_year.md` — You can refine these over time

That's it. You're ready to use the system daily.

### Daily Use (5 minutes)

Every evening or morning:
- Open `/reviews/daily/`
- Create a new file named `YYYY-MM-DD.md` (e.g., `2025-01-15.md`)
- Copy the template from the first daily check-in you'll find in that folder
- Answer the five prompts honestly
- Save and close

**That's the whole system.** Everything else is optional scaffolding.

### Weekly Use (15 minutes)

Every Friday or Sunday:
- Open `/reviews/weekly/`
- Create a new file named `YYYY-Www.md` (e.g., `2025-W03.md`)
- Use the weekly review template
- Reflect on the week and plan one adjustment

### Quarterly Use (60-90 minutes)

Every 90 days (March 31, June 30, Sept 30, Dec 31):
- Open `/reviews/quarterly/`
- Create a new file named `YYYY-Qn.md` (e.g., `2025-Q1.md`)
- Use the quarterly review template
- This is your strategic recalibration moment

### Annual Use (3-4 hours, schedule as a full morning)

Once per year (ideally late December or early January):
- Block a full morning when you won't be interrupted
- Open `/reviews/annual/`
- Create `YYYY_annual_review.md`
- Work through the annual review template
- Update your Life Map, Vivid Vision, and long-term goals

## How to Upload Past Documents

Have past annual reviews, performance reviews, or personal notes you want to learn from?

1. Save them as text or markdown files in `/uploads/past_annual_reviews/` or `/uploads/notes/`
2. Open `memory.md` in the root folder
3. Add a summary of key patterns, repeated themes, blind spots, or insights
4. Reference these patterns in your future reviews

The system will help you see what you've been saying for years but not acting on.

## Understanding the Frameworks

All frameworks live in `/frameworks/`. They're explained in plain language, not productivity jargon.

- **Annual Review** (Dr. Anthony Gustin): Structured year-in-review with highlights, lowlights, lessons, and future intent
- **Vivid Vision** (Tony Robbins-style): Describe your ideal future in present tense, with emotional detail
- **Ideal Lifestyle Costing** (Tim Ferriss): Calculate what your dream life actually costs (usually less than you think)
- **Life Map** (Alex Lieberman): Track satisfaction across six domains: career, relationships, health, meaning, finances, fun

You don't need to use all of them. Pick what resonates. Ignore the rest.

---

## Philosophy of This System

This system assumes:
- You are **not lazy**, you are **misaligned**
- Clarity comes from **reflection**, not more information
- Goals without **energy management** are just wishes
- The question isn't "What do I want to achieve?" but "**What life do I want to live?**"
- **Patterns repeat** until you name them

This is a high-trust system. No one is watching. No metrics to game. No performative productivity.

It's just you, a text editor, and the truth.

## Common Questions

**Do I have to do this every day?**
No. The daily check-in is designed to take 5 minutes and provide immediate clarity. If you skip days, you skip days. The system doesn't judge.

**What if I don't know my "North Star" yet?**
Leave it blank. Come back to it after doing a few weekly reviews or an interview. Clarity comes from reflection, not pressure.

**Can I modify the templates?**
Yes. This is **your** system. Edit, delete, or expand anything that doesn't serve you.

**What if I fall behind on reviews?**
Start where you are. Don't backfill missed days. The point is clarity moving forward, not perfect records.

**Is this therapy?**
No. This is structured reflection designed for decision-makers. If deeper work is needed, find a coach or therapist.

## Credits and Inspiration

This system incorporates and adapts frameworks from:
- **Dr. Anthony Gustin** — Annual Review structure
- **Tim Ferriss** — Ideal Lifestyle Costing
- **Tony Robbins** — Vivid Vision thinking
- **Alex Lieberman** — Life Map framework

All frameworks have been translated into CEO-friendly language and adapted for private, single-user reflection.

## Final Note

This system works if you use it honestly.

It fails if you perform for an imaginary audience.

There are no points for perfect reviews. There are no dashboards. No one is grading you.

This is a mirror, not a report card.

Use it to see clearly. Adjust. Move forward.

That's the whole game.
