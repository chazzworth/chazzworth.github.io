## Final Note

10 years from now, this document will be wrong.

Not because you failed, but because life doesn't follow spreadsheets.

The point is not to predict the future.

The point is to **design a direction** — so that when opportunities and crises arise, you have a compass.

Every decision you make either moves you toward this vision or away from it.

Some detours will be worth it. Others won't.

But you can't know which is which without clarity on where you're going.

This is that clarity.

Use it.

Revise it.

Live it.
