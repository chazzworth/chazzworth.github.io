# 3-Year Goals

**Time horizon:** [START YEAR] - [END YEAR]

**Last updated:** [DATE]

## Why 3 Years?

**1 year is too short** to make fundamental changes to your business, career, or life.

**10 years is too long** to feel actionable or real.

**3 years is the sweet spot** — long enough to transform, short enough to commit to.

Use this document to define the **major shifts** you want to make in your professional and personal life.

## Before You Set 3-Year Goals

**Have you written your Vivid Vision?** (See `/frameworks/vivid_vision.md`)

If not, do that first. 3-year goals should move you toward a clear future, not a vague aspiration.

**Have you completed your Life Map?** (See `/frameworks/life_map.md`)

If not, do that first. You need to know which domains are misaligned before setting long-term goals.

**Have you calculated your Ideal Lifestyle Cost?** (See `/frameworks/ideal_life_costing.md`)

If not, do that first. Financial goals without this context are just guesses.

## Final Reminder

Three years is long enough to transform your life.

But only if you're intentional.

These goals are not predictions. They're commitments.

And commitments can change.

If you realize halfway through that you're building toward the wrong future, stop.

Sunk cost is not a reason to keep climbing the wrong mountain.

Stay aligned. Stay honest.

That's the whole game.
