# 1-Year Goals

**Year:** [YEAR]

**Last updated:** [DATE]

## Before You Set Goals

**Have you completed your Annual Review?** (See `/reviews/annual/` and `/frameworks/annual_review.md`)

If not, do that first. Goals without reflection are just optimism.

**Have you defined your North Star?** (See `north_star.md`)

If not, at least draft it. Goals without values are just metrics to game.

**Have you written your Vivid Vision?** (See `/frameworks/vivid_vision.md`)

If not, you might be setting goals that move you toward the wrong future.

## Final Reminder

Goals are not a contract. They're a hypothesis.

If a goal stops serving you, change it.

If you realize halfway through the year that you're chasing the wrong thing, stop.

The system serves you. Not the other way around.
